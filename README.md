## Overview  
The **Roll the Dice** app is a simple and interactive dice-rolling application. Just tap on either of the two dice, and watch both dice roll to generate random numbers between 1 and 6. It's a great tool for games, decision-making, or just some quick fun!

## Features  
- **Dual Dice Rolling**: Click on one dice, and both dice roll simultaneously.  
- **Randomized Results**: Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6 for both dice.  
- **Interactive Design**: Clean and responsive interface, perfect for casual use.  
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimalist app for quick and seamless dice rolls.  

## Usage  
Simply click on either of the dice to roll both. The numbers will update instantly with a randomized result. Perfect for tabletop games, quick decisions, or for when youâ€™ve misplaced your physical dice.
